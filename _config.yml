description: Tejal Wakchoure's Personal Website. Hi! I'm Tejal. I'm a software developer, UI & UX designer, and film enthusiast. I currently live in Mumbai, India. Previously, I built code at Goldman Sachs. I earned a degree in computer science at BITS Pilani and pursued my undergraduate thesis with Andrew Lippman at the MIT Media Lab. I like to work on projects that are design-oriented and solve real-world human-computer interaction (HCI) problems. I like to work with people who value empathy-driven development. My research interests are interdisciplinary - I enjoy blending ideas from HCI and product design with literature, cinema, and economics. During my time at MIT, I worked on politics and computer vision for a grassroots-level analysis of news media. Here is an interview on my experience!
