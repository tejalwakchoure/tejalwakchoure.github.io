        I currently build code at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a> and live in Mumbai, India. I studied computer science at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a> and pursued my undergraduate thesis with <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~lip/" target="_blank">Andrew Lippman</a> at the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>.

        I like to work on projects that are design-oriented and solve real-world human-computer interaction (HCI) problems. I like to work with people who value empathy-driven development. My research interests are interdisciplinary -  I enjoy blending ideas from HCI and product design with literature, cinema, and economics. During my time at MIT, I worked on politics and computer vision for a <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/superglue/overview/" target="_blank">grassroots-level analysis of news media</a>. <a href="https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com/2020/08/04/578/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interview on my experience!

        In the summer of 2019, I interned with Goldman where I developed a React-based web interface. That process drove me to explore UI design, and I've been fascinated with it ever since. I soon coded up <a href="https://github.com/tejalwakchoure/tejalwakchoure.github.io" target="_blank">this website</a> and helped implement <a href="https://github.com/tejalwakchoure/loveletters-premium" target="_blank">one of my favourite tabletop games</a>. At university, I was also a student representative for <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/ind-programs" target="_blank">Microsoft Codess</a>.

        When I'm not <a href="https://github.com/tejalwakchoure?tab=repositories" target="_blank">coding up random stuff</a>, I:
        <ul style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
          <li>
          make games on <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> and illustrate on <a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank">Krita</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
          write. Back in university, I was an editor for our literary and technical magazine.
          </li>
          <li>
          attend pub quizzes and play CMS games. I am currently obsessed with Rollercoaster Tycoon.
          </li>
          <li>
          listen to pop-rock and Indian indie fusion rock. I firmly believe that the '00s were the coolest decade for pop music.
          </li>
          <li>
          read fiction. My favourite in 2021 so far has been <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127718-anxious-people" target="_blank">Anxious People</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
          watch and dissect movies/TV shows. I am currently watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2531336/" target="_blank">Lupin</a>! K-drama is a not-so-guilty pleasure of mine (if you're into it, I recommend <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10850932/" target="_blank">CLOY</a>).
          </li>

        If you have an exciting opportunity that I would be a great fit for, please <span class="page-scroll"><a href="#contact">contact me</a></span>. Found an interesting article on UI/UX or cinema studies? I'd love to chat!
