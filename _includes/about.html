        I currently live in Mumbai, India. Previously, I built code at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>. I earned a degree in computer science at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a> and pursued my undergraduate thesis with <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~lip/" target="_blank">Andrew Lippman</a> at the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a>.

        I like to work on projects that are design-oriented and solve real-world human-computer interaction (HCI) problems. I enjoy working with people who value empathy-driven development. My interests are interdisciplinary, blending concepts from HCI and product design with literature, art, and economics.

        Back in 2019, a summer internship project drove me to explore UI design, and I have been fascinated with it ever since. I built <a href="https://github.com/tejalwakchoure/tejalwakchoure.github.io" target="_blank">this website</a> and implemented <a href="https://github.com/tejalwakchoure/loveletters-premium" target="_blank">one of my favourite tabletop games</a>. For my thesis, I worked on politics and computer vision for a <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/superglue/overview/" target="_blank">grassroots-level analysis of news media</a>. (<a href="https://bitsrnd.wordpress.com/2020/08/04/578/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interview on my experience!)

        When I'm not <a href="https://github.com/tejalwakchoure?tab=repositories" target="_blank">coding up random stuff</a>, I:
        <ul class="about-list">
          <li>
          write. Back in university, I was an editor for our literary and technical magazine.
          </li>
          <li>
          illustrate on <a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank">Krita</a>. It's not much, but it's honest work :)
          </li>
          <li>
          attend pub quizzes and play CMS games. I have a soft spot for Rollercoaster Tycoon.
          </li>
          <li>
          listen to pop rock. I firmly believe that the '00s was the greatest decade for pop music.
          </li>
          <li>
          read fiction. My current favourite is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone" target="_blank">Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
          watch and dissect movies/TV shows. I am obsessed with Vox's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8005374/" target="_blank">Explained</a> series.
          </li>
        </ul>
