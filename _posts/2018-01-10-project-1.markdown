description: A mailing list parser that extracts information such as senders and time stamps from an IMAP server-based mailing list and uses this information to construct conversation thread hypergraphs. Time-varying network analyses of these hypergraphs reveal participant behavior and communication patterns which can be used to form predictive models to understand the intricate characteristics of a social network.
