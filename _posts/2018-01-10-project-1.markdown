summary: A mailing list parser that constructs time-varying conversation thread hypergraphs revealing communication patterns to form predictive models for the network.

description: The main objective of this project is to develop an IMAP server-based mailing list parser to extract information such as senders and time stamps. The study of these interactions helped us construct organisational structures and derive the local and global communication patterns between users on different threads. The objective of this research was to answer questions about the invariant characteristics of a discussion thread, updates to mailing list filters to remove spam messages for subscribers, and modelling theÂ temporal behaviour of authors. <br /> <br /> This project can be used to identify the structure of a community, track the experts on channels, formulate graphs for making predictive models, and assign weights based on the activeness of each user amongst other activities. For example, in cases where discussions happen slowly in time, authors arrive slowly and the discussion spans many generations of nodes. In contrast, when discussions end quickly, authors arrive quickly and the discussion ends within a few generations. This difference in the temporal characteristics of the authors is related to the popularity of the topic. Authors come in quickly from many sources for popular topics but for specialised topics, help trickles in slowly over time. The question we ask then is, what are these popular threads? Can text mining help us detect them? <br /> <br /> We used the Infomap community detection algorithm for multilevel community detection analysis and associate relevant labels through text mining. Keywords were extracted after tokenization and lemmatization of the mails using the WordNet lemmatizer. A custom set of stop words that included common English words along with frequently used technical jargon were removed after tokenization to form a keyword digest of the authors to further detect participant behaviour and communication patterns.
