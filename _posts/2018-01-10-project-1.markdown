summary: A mailing list parser that constructs time-varying conversation thread hypergraphs revealing communication patterns to form predictive models for the network.

description: The main objective of this project is to develop an IMAP server-based mailing list parser to extract information such as senders and time stamps. The study of these interactions helped us construct organisational structures and derive local and global communication patterns. The objective of this research was to answer questions about the invariant characteristics of a discussion thread, updates to mailing list filters to remove spam messages for subscribers, and modelling ofÂ temporal behaviour. We used the Infomap community detection algorithm for multilevel community detection analysis. Relevant labels were associated from text mined using the WordNet lemmatizer. <br /> <br /> This project can be used to identify the structure of the community, make predictive models, and assign weights based on the activeness of each user amongst other activities. For example, in cases where discussions happen slowly in time, authors arrive slowly and the discussion spans many generations of nodes. When discussions end quickly, however, authors arrive quickly and the discussion ends within a few generations. We can attribute this behaviour to the popularity of the topic - authors come in from many sources for popular and generic topics but for specialised ones, help trickles in slowly. The question we ask then is, what are these popular threads? Can text mining help us detect them?
