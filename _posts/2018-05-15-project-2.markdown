summary: Health-based classification of patient data into 8 different classes with high real-time diagnostic accuracy.

description: The aim of this project was originally to obtain predictions on medical diagnoses noted by professionals to make their roles smoother. However, while gathering data for this project from the hospital, we encountered an issue - all the patient data for the past 30 years was handwritten. This led us to a second research direction, namely digitising all that data using machine learning algorithms. <br /> <br /> The classification model notes out-of-range test values and makes a prediction based on these analyses to help the doctor diagnose appropriately. The model is built with <a href="">PyTorch</a> and uses a <a href="">Convolutional Neural Network</a> to create health-based classification using exploratory data analysis techniques like <a href="">Principal Component Analysis</a> and <a href="">t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding</a>. The training dataset comprising the expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of mice was grouped into 8 classes. We used <a href="">Optical Character Recognition</a> to digitise the physical files.
