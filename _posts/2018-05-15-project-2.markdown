description: Health-based classification into 8 different classes using a convolutional neural network architecture that uses exploratory data analysis techniques like principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. The dataset is based on the expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of mice. A real-time diagnostic accuracy of 99.7% is obtained on the predictions.
