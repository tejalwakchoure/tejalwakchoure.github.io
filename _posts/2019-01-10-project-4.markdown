description: Currently, the process of recording attendance in an academic institution is a time-consuming practice. It is also subject to a lot of fraudulence as it is very simple for students to register attendance for their peers on a sheet that is passed around a classroom. Oftentimes this creates bias and, for courses that follow a relative grading system with a high percentage of total marks attributed to an attendance component, it can cause an unfair allotment of grades. It aims to make the system more transparent and professorsâ€™ administrative workload much lighter. <br /> <br /> 
we created an android app that automatically records student attendance based on facial recognition input by the students and teachers. <br /> <br /> 
this was a four-month long project. <br /> <br /> 
I worked on the UI as well as the algorithm for this project. the UI was done in android studio with java/XML and the algorithm was in python. <br /> <br /> 
the UI had separate landings for students and teachers, with provisions for courses, grading, etc for an integrated experience. <br /> <br /> 
Hardware Android, Software Android Studio, OpenCV for face detection, Tensorflow for face recognition
