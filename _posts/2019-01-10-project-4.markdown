description: A facial recognition-based attendance system built to improve transparency in student-teacher interaction, reduce instances of bias, and raise the overall administrative efficiency. It uses a transfer learning model that recognizes facial features with 98% accuracy, trained on a high-density database with 1000+ images. The complete system is deployed as an Android application with dashboards and registration services for effortless daily interaction. <br> <br> Currently, the process of recording attendance in an academic institution is a time-consuming practice. It is also subject to a lot of fraudulence as it is very simple for students to register attendance for their peers on a sheet that is passed around a classroom. Oftentimes this creates bias and, for courses that follow a relative grading system with a high percentage of total marks attributed to an attendance component, it can cause an unfair allotment of grades. It aims to make the system more transparent and professorsâ€™ administrative workload much lighter. <br> <br> we created an android app that automatically records student attendance based on facial recognition input by the students and teachers. <br> <br> Hardware: Android, Software: Android Studio, OpenCV for face detection, Tensorflow for face recognition <br> <br> this was a four-month long project. <br> <br> I worked on the UI as well as the algorithm for this project. the UI was done in android studio with java/XML and the algorithm was in python. the UI had separate landings for students and teachers, with provisions for courses, grading, etc for an integrated experience.
