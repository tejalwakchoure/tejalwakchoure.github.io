summary: A facial recognition-based Android attendance system built to improve transparency that recognises facial features with 98% accuracy, trained on a high-density database with 1000+ images.

description: In many academic institutions, attendance is still recorded manually. This is a time-consuming practice subject to considerable amounts of fraudulence. We created a facial recognition-based attendance system in order to tackle these issues thereby improving transparency in student-teacher interaction, reducing instances of bias, and raising overall administrative efficiency. <br /> <br /> The system was deployed as an Android app that automatically records student attendance based on input by the students and teachers. Wee built a transfer learning model using OpenCV for face detection and TensorFlow for face recognition. We created the interface in Java/XML with comprehensive landings for students and teachers including provisions for courses, grading, dashboards, and registration services for effortless daily interaction.
