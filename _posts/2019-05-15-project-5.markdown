summary: An end-to-end framework that queries data from Data Lake, Sybase IQ, and Elasticsearch simultaneously to create a flat view for data collection.

description: If a user wanted to query data from 3 different sources, he would have to go to 3 platforms, get results from each of them, and manually merge them. The idea behind this project was to create a framework that queries these sources simultaneously to create a flat view for data collection. The user would then just have to run a single query from a comprehensive UI. The framework would execute it on different sources internally to produce a consolidated result. This solves the problem of smooth lateral data extraction and increases the efficiency of the database management system considerably. <br /> <br /> I designed and implemented the user interface for this project. The calls sent to the middleware were SQL queries compiled from the user's selections on the UI. It was a responsive web interface created with ReactJS, integrated with the backend services using RESTful APIs to create a seamless user experience.
