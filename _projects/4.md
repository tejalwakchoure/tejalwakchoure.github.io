summary: A facial recognition-based Android attendance system built to improve transparency, trained on a high-density database with 1000+ images.
type: UI/UX Design, Facial recognition

description: Student attendance is still recorded manually in many academic institutions. This is a time-consuming practice subject to considerable amounts of fraudulence. We created a facial recognition-based attendance system to tackle these concerns, thereby improving transparency in student-teacher interaction, reducing instances of bias, and raising overall administrative efficiency. <br /> <br /> The system was deployed as an Android app that automatically records student attendance based on input by the students and teachers. We built a transfer learning model using <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> for face detection and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> for face recognition. The Java/XML user interface has extensive landings for students and teachers, including provisions for courses, grading, dashboards, and registration services for effortless daily interaction.
