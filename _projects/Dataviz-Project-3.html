       		With the increased use of open source software, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has become a popular form of synchronous communication. The primary objective of this study was to track the development of the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat" target="_blank">Ubuntu IRC</a> community over time and examine the dynamically changing participation patterns. The aims of this analysis were twofold - to delineate substructures and calculate the frequency of discussion of concepts in the network. <br /> <br /> We constructed a community model for information flow to assist and assess knowledge transfer and filter messages to split participants into groups for greater efficiency. We provided a new perspective on generalizing the pattern of these relationships, studying linguistic behaviour using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a> approaches like reply structure and word context in conjunction with <a href="https://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi's</a> clustering analysis and inferential modelling algorithms. <br /> <br /> Users are often subjected to long wait times for developers to resolve their queries, increasing the possibility that the question gets buried under others. Our second aim was to benefit the learning community by capturing the topic-wise rate of discussion to reduce this loss of knowledge transfer. We created a python-based application that helps users note this frequency, increasing the ease of usage of the forum substantially. Detecting the distinct topics also helped match users to chat rooms, optimize chat queries, and trace subject changes within a channel.
