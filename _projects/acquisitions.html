						With the tech industry facing unprecedented financial problems, I was surprised to see Alphabet <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2022-10-11-google-discreetly-acquires-edtech-analytics-company-brightbytes" target="_blank">continue to acquire</a> companies through the end of 2022. This led me to an exploration of their M&A strategy and how it has changed over time.

							Since 2001, Google has acquired 254 companies including giants like Android and YouTube. Some of these acquisitions haven't worked out, including Slide (bought for $182M, shut down after 2 years) and Motorola Mobility (bought for $12.5B, sold for $3B after 2 years). But due to the sheer number of fields that Google operates in, most of these businesses have been integrated into its existing products.

								Over 10% of the companies that Google has acquired operated in the mobile domain. These mergers supplemented the growth of Android over the past two decades. Since its acquisition in 2005, Android has grown to reach 3 billion users worldwide. It now holds 71% of the global market share for operating systems.
