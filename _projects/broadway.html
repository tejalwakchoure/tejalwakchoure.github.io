							I recently saw pop star JoJo play Satine in <span class="italic">Moulin Rouge</span>'s most recent run on Broadway. While it's not unheard of for artists to move into sister fields, it felt like a fever dream to see her in her new glittery persona. <a href="https://www.broadwayleague.com/research/statistics-broadway-nyc/" target="_blank">Over 12 million people</a> attended the 2022-23 Broadway season, the first full-fledged season since 
							<a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/broadway-goes-dark-covid19-pandemic" target="_blank">COVID-19 shut theatres down</a>. Long considered the highest form of theatre, it remains a dream for most musical actors. This raises the question—who gets to go on Broadway?

							Most performers don't begin as 
							<a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/jojo/" target="_blank">
							Billboard Hot 100-topping singers at the age of 13</a>, but many of them do start with family connections. 15 out of every 100 opening night cast members for current shows were born into prominent families. Although musical theatre is not nearly as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/hollywood-nepotism-babies-list-taxonomy.html" target="_blank">nepotistic as Hollywood</a>, the fact that it is part of the entertainment industry means that it still places a priority on relationships. Here are some performers whose relatives have a Wikipedia page—the true mark of stardom.

						<h3 class="project-heading">You go to NYU</h3>
						<p>
							A staggering 40 percent of stars who went to college attended one of 5 schools. New York University is at the top by a large margin, beating specialized schools like Juilliard and the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA). NYU alumni include 
							<span class="italic">Wicked</span>'s Idina Menzel, 
							<span class="italic">The Book of Mormon</span>'s Jared Gertner, and 
							<span class="italic">Kimberly Akimbo</span>'s Victoria Clark.

						<p class="mt5">
							It's worth noting that while most of these stars have received a professional education, many have also opted not to go to college. These performers usually start as child actors, as in the case of <span class="italic">Grey House</span>'s Mia Sinclair Jenness (who also happens to be actress Emily Bauer's daughter) and industry veterans Neil Patrick Harris and Adam Godley.

						<h3 class="project-heading">You have performed on-screen</h3>
						<p>
							Musical theatre is a competitive field with few winners on top – only 176 of all 783 opening night cast members for current shows have Wikipedia pages, and many of them are because of crossovers in other parts of the entertainment industry. So, many performers choose to start their careers with advertisements or small roles in TV shows. For instance, out of the 22 cast members of the 2015 smash hit <span class="italic">Hamilton</span>, 16 had already appeared on screen. Renée Elise Goldsberry, who won the Tony Award for best featured actress in a musical for her role as Angelica Schuyler, already had 26 film and TV credits to her name before opening night.

							<span class="bold">Methodology</span>
							<br>
							Shows and cast lists were scraped from IBDB. While the IBDB database mentions 783 opening night cast members (including ensemble and understudies) for all of the shows currently playing on Broadway, only 176 of these had enough information about them on the internet. This information was scraped from the actors' Wikipedia and Playbill profiles. 'School' here refers to the most recent school the actor attended, usually an MFA program.
