                <p class="italic">The good Princess Annette, heartbroken over the recent arrest of her mother Queen Marianna for high treason, has locked herself in the palace. You are a suitor trying to ease her pain by sending her letters of love. Since you cannot reach her immediately, you must rely on intermediaries to carry your message.</p>

                  We had just been sent home from college due to the pandemic. Bored and restless, two of us implemented one of our favourite board games, Love Letter, onto a locally-hosted web platform so that we could play it with our friends over Zoom. The interface included the layout and positioning of 18 cards and 3 screens which incorporated all gameplay controls (cards, points, tokens) to support interactive online play for up to 8 players.

                <p>
                  Our aim was to make a simple, intuitive web application that would bring back the experience of playing a cozy board game with our loved ones. Love Letter is a strategy card game at its core, so I focused on three main goals:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> Clean:</span> Steer clear of any unnecessary components and keep the focus on gameplay.</li>
                      <li>
                        <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Simple:</span> Keep the design intuitive so that someone with little to no experience with technology would be able to play.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Community:</span> Match the original gameplay to retain the vibe of the game and maintain a sense of community.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
                </div>

                    <div class="col">
                      <p>Since this is an online game, I went for a contemporary and friendly aesthetic. I went for a gentle colour palette, easy-to-read typography, and intuitive iconography (to indicate any status changes).</p>

                    <h6>USER SCENARIO</h6>
                    <p>With the game being virtual and server-hosted, there can be a disconnect between players which may lead to them not knowing what's going on.</p>
                    <h6>SOLUTION</h6>
                    <p>Ensured that all player screens are in sync with each other. Each player could see what was going on as if they were sitting in a circle.</p>

                    <h6>SOLUTION</h6>
                    <p>Introduced simple icons which you would come across daily.</p>

                       <li>The cards in the used pile could be more simplified. Currently difficult to see the card numbers clearly on mobile.</li>
